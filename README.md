# Titanic Data Analysis

## Introduction
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we aim to analyze the data related to the Titanic passengers and determine which categories of people were more likely to survive the disaster. This analysis will provide insights into the factors that influenced the chances of survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about the Titanic passengers, such as their survival status, ticket class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, passenger fare, cabin number, and port of embarkation.

The data dictionary for the dataset is as follows:

- `Survival`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `Age`: Age of the passenger in years
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- `Ticket`: Ticket number
- `Fare`: Passenger fare
- `Cabin`: Cabin number
- `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
